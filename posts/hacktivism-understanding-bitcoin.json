It is less about sabotage than about alternatives.\r\n\r\nHacktivism allows dissent to overcome the limitations of protest, actually implementing alternatives and making them widely available without asking for permission from the status quo. It gives wings to the possibility for gradual peaceful revolution: alternatives no longer need to remain dreams, but can become real options for real people.\r\n\r\nHacktivism often opens real spaces by \"selling the idea\" first to the machines, after which people realise other ways are possible and allow themselves to think in new ways.<\/blockquote>","date":"June 9, 2012 22:34","title":"Hacktivism \/ Understanding Bitcoin [Aljazeera]","article_css":"","template_file":false,"categories":["Technology"],"author":"Michael Flanagan"}
