All digital, of course. I'm not sure anyone argues the case for using film in still photography anymore. At least not for anything beyond sheer appreciation.\n\nAlthough I remember clearly, in the beginning, they did. To the extent that not only were the tools of the day insufficient in comparison to \"real\" photography (they were) but also that digital could <em>never<\/em> reach the same levels of quality nor, consequently, acceptance as the analogue counterpart.\n\nAnyone with an understanding of technology might see the issue of <em>image quality<\/em> as being only a matter of time, but it's interesting that winning that battle wasn't really the great triumph that made digital as ubiquitous as it is today. That <em>most<\/em> triumphant victory over it's predecessor turned out to be all the things you never could have dreamt of.\n\nIt's difficult to fathom the idea of instant previews or the freedom to shoot everything and edit later without having a frame of reference. Instagram, Twitter, and instant publishing, or the notion that a point-and-shoot will one day rival the quality and features of an SLR \u2013 and a <em>mobile phone<\/em> rival them both \u2013 would have been all but inconceivable in the world at that time. In today's world, it's simply difficult not to take all those things for granted.\n\nI can remember similar sentiments, some still being expressed to varying degrees, around music, video, books, magazines and I'm sure others. In each case there's an argument of quality or something lost in the transition, and in each case technology has or will improve to equalize and compensate where it has to. But again, I believe the <em>real<\/em> value comes from the <em>possibilities<\/em>. From what's <em>new<\/em>, not from the few bits comparable to the past.\n\nDigital photography isn't better because we've got more megapixels now. It's better because the journalist on assignment can beam her shots around the world the instant they're taken and publish live from the field. It's better because <em>I can do that too<\/em>! Image quality doesn't mater a half next to that. That's exciting.\n\nToday that analogue camera comes to mind when I listen to people talk about education and politics. A digital revolution in these areas needn't result in a like for like replacement of established norms to be successful or worthwhile. It's foolish to think that they would. The established norms in education are incompatible with a world where Wikipedia and Udacity and GitHub exist. Politics is something else when everyone <em>really can<\/em> have a voice. \n\nAs a tool in our current system, and mindset, the Internet can only do so much to improve upon what's already there. But as an abstract, taken as something new and unique from the old, the possibilities are untold.\n\nAnd that, I think, is really exciting.","excerpt":"Watching a professional photographer at work today.

Following a couple of guides made the whole thing fairly painless \u2013\u00a0so mostly I'm just going to point towards them, with a couple of notes of my own.\r\n\r\n<h3>VPN?<\/h3>\r\nFirstly, a VPN server (those who know can skip this bit) is literally a <em>Virtual Private Network<\/em>. You might be familiar with how your home or office network operates \u2013 many computers connected to the same WiFi or ethernet network. For the most part we do this simply to share an Internet connection, however, another upshot is the ability to share files and services (e.g. documents, audio, video, printers or scanners) between these machines \u2013 with access only available to machines on your <em>local network<\/em>.\r\n\r\nYou can think of a VPN in similar terms, only the <em>Local<\/em> is replaced with <em>Virtual Private<\/em>. The physical connection between what were once, by necessity, centrally located machines is replaced with a Virtual connection \u2013 and your access to those files and services is now available from any authenticated machine with a data connection, anywhere in the world. Pretty cool.\r\n\r\n<h3>OK, what do I need?<\/h3>\r\n\r\nAt it's simplest, creating a VPN requires two components \u2013\u00a0you need a server running the server component, and a client to connect to it. Actually it only <em>really<\/em> starts making sense when you have two clients (a network of one isn't much of a network!), but the setting up of the second is just the same as the first.\r\n\r\n<h4>Client<\/h4>\r\nYour first client could be the machine you're reading this on now, or any laptop or computer you want to use. \r\n\r\nMy client machine is running Linux (Mint 14). If you're on an Apple machine most of this guide should still be relevant \u2013 although perhaps the client setup will differ.\r\n\r\n<h4>Server<\/h4>\r\nFor the server I decided to use Amazon Web Services, mostly because I've still got a few months left on their <a href=\"http:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/free\/\" target=\"_blank\">Free Usage Tier<\/a> and you just can't beat that price.\r\n\r\n<h3>Step 1 \u2013 Setting up on Amazon Web Services<\/h3>\r\nThis\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/expedienttech.net\/?p=68\" target=\"_blank\">guide by Expedient Tech<\/a>\u00a0covers setting up your EC2 server. Follow this but go for Ubuntu 12.04 instead of 9.1. I don't see any reason to go back that far, maybe the guide is just old.\r\n\r\nWhen they start talking about using PuTTy and installing OpenVPN that way, forget about it. That's crazy Windows talk. All you need is shell access and by now you have the pem key from amazon, so \u2013\u00a0on your client machine \u2013 you just need to fire up a terminal window and type:\r\n\r\n<code>ssh -i \/path\/to\/yourkey.pem\u00a0ubuntu@your-sever-address.amazonaws.com<\/code>\r\n\r\nYou should now be logged-in to your new Amazon EC2 instance.\r\n\r\n<h3>Step 2 & 3 \u2013 OpenVPN Client and Server<\/h3>\r\nNow switch to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/help.ubuntu.com\/12.04\/serverguide\/openvpn.html\" target=\"_blank\">Ubuntu 12.04's OpenVPN guide<\/a>. Follow those steps to the letter and you should be setup on both Server and Client.\r\n\r\n<h3>And...<\/h3>\r\nAnd.. that should be that! You can generate a second client certificate the same way you've done the first and connect a second machine. Each client connected to the network is given a unique IP address available only to other machines on the network, allowing you to connect and share securely. Sit happily in a coffee shop while you finish up a project on the machine back home, via your humble little laptop. Or stream music from your private collection through your phone at a party.\r\n\r\nLots of fun.","excerpt":"I finally got around to setting up my VPN server last night on Amazon Web Services.

This is just about the order you watch them in.\r\n\r\nTurned out to be a great way to watch the films. Nothing is missed from leaving out episode one and the remaining two prequel episodes fit in at a time, just after Empire Strikes Back, when you're perfectly primed and eager to learn more about the Anakin\/Vader backstory. And it all gets nicely concluded with Episode 6.\r\n\r\nViewing in chronological order, 1 to 6 or even 2 to 6, is far too much information far too soon. The mystery of Darth Vader is diminished by the time you get to Episode 4, the revelation in 5 is meaningless.\r\n\r\nViewing in release order isn't much better. With 4 to 6 followed by 1 to 3, you're left with an ending in the middle and a middle at the end (Episode 3 ends on quite a downer!). So really, 'Machete Order' makes a lot of sense.\r\n\r\nAlso nice to remember that A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back are still fantastic films. Thoroughly enjoyed watching them both again. Attack of the Clones was the worst of the bunch by a fair margin but after Empire the backstory and details do at least seem more interesting. Revenge of the Sith was much better than I remembered! And Return of the Jedi was pretty much just as I'd remembered. Good in places, silly or dull in others, and the cast seems a little less enthusiastic and a bit older all of a sudden.\r\n\r\nAnd if you're going to do this -- or watch any Star Wars ever again -- do yourself a favour, Google and download the 'Despecialized Edition'.

Indexable, searchable (findable) by anyone -- and readable by a legion of scripts and bots to serve up the very best Google Ads, relevant to the content on the page. <em>Of course<\/em> they're going to protest the \"walled garden\" approach.\r\n\r\nHowever, the reality is that the walled garden approach to Internet services simply\u00a0<em>is<\/em>\u00a0rubbish. Fair play to Google for working with a business model which encourages, and relies upon, open and free access to information. I'm not suggesting Google are perfect or saintly but they at least seem a good\u00a0ally\u00a0in the very worthwhile fight to foster and protect the free flow of information.\r\n\r\nI think sometimes irrational and often over-blown fears about Internet privacy are both encouraged and taken advantage of by these walled gardened supporters, who spin \"your data won't be indexed\/searchable\" into a selling point. The comments on the Guardian article linked above reflect that pretty strongly.\r\n\r\nA level of privacy is important -- the ability to have private conversations and personal relationships hugely important, of course -- but one shouldn't be afraid to be themselves and express their thoughts because they might be \"tracked\" or \"indexed\" by someone, something, a search engine, or a\u00a0government. I believe the <em>openness<\/em>\u00a0of the web should be strongly encouraged -- both from a technological and a personal point of view.\r\n\r\nI don't mind that information I put out onto the Internet is indexed. I'm\u00a0fascinated\u00a0by what can be achieved, calculated and predicted by having access to vast amounts of data like that. And I particularly like the fact that <em>anyone<\/em>\u00a0can do it. With an open web, knowledge is truly democratic.\r\n\r\nWhat I fear is that erecting\u00a0barriers to 'protect' ourselves from the open web is counter-productive to achieving the Internet's full potential on many levels. Socially and politically it makes an easy target of anyone who <em>does<\/em> express alternative points of view, much harder for that person to find support, and -- if the Internet were to become dominated by these\u00a0<em>singularly-controlled<\/em>\u00a0<wbr>walled gardens -- trivial for any subversive thought to be stamped out before it begins.<\/wbr>\r\n\r\nWhat I'd like to see is not 1, 2 or 3 Internet silos which we fill with our data. What I'd like to see is a return to, or at least broader encouragement of, personal websites under control of one individual -- all interconnected using open standards.\r\n\r\nThe Internet, or the public manifestation of it, still feels like a very new frontier, but perhaps not as young and innocent as it once was. Where it once seemed\u00a0direction-less\u00a0and full of\u00a0endless\u00a0possibilities, it's starting to seem as though the tracks are getting laid down and decisions being made about the direction they face. If we're heading to a place where the worlds knowledge and information (social or otherwise) is\u00a0closed and locked-up for \"our security\", under control of just a few (and their customers), well that's not the ticket I queued up for.","excerpt":"I think some common notions on the importance of Internet &#8220;privacy&#8221; are misguided.

Someone cleared it up: look at the contracts.\r\n\r\nMeteor have <a href=\"https:\/\/store.meteor.ie\/phones\/bill-pay-phones\/apple-iphone-4s\">special contracts<\/a> for their iPhone users. These start at \u20ac45\/month for 24 months, which gets you 200 texts, 200 minutes and 5GB of data. Plus the \u20ac49 once-off fee, that means you're locked into paying <strong>\u20ac1174<\/strong> for the phone + service over 2 years.\r\n\r\nThe Android phones use the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meteor.ie\/bill-pay\/#phone-plans\">standard meteor contracts<\/a>: a minimum \u20ac20\/month for 18 months, getting you 200 texts, 200 minutes and 1GB of data. (18 * 20) + 119 = <strong>\u20ac479<\/strong>. So actually, much <em>much<\/em> cheaper. Just a bit more up front.\r\n\r\nThe only difference the iPhone contract has over a standard contract is the tasty 5GB of data (compared with 1GB) but if you need more than one (which is probably fine for most), a 10GB add-on costs \u20ac15.24\/month, and that's still cheaper: (18 * 20) + 119 + (18 * 16) = \u20ac767.

These days I try to stop\u00a0apologising and making excuses. I don't crave the attention of a crowd and I don't gain energy from the energy and\u00a0enthusiasm\u00a0of having many people around me. In those situations I find myself sitting quietly, observing, listening. I'll form my opinions and contribute in my own way, in my own time. I don't enjoy the rabble.\r\n\r\nPeople observing this often put it down to shyness, social awkwardness or an unhealthy aversion to people. That's not the case. Forcing yourself to conform to an outgoing extrovert norm <em>can<\/em>\u00a0be awkward -- as much as trying anything which goes against your natural instincts and impulses -- but as an introvert needs seem different to the majority who require regular social interactions for a steady, healthy mind. I like the small doses, absolutely, but without having my time alone to recharge, think, dream and create -- I'm liable to get a little cranky.\r\n\r\nThe difference of\u00a0acceptance\u00a0is that I'm now willing to embrace the time alone, trying to make the most out of it and not feeling guilty or\u00a0inadequate\u00a0for sitting in with a cup of tea researching <a href=\"http:\/\/nodejs.org\/\">Node.js<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.codecademy.com\/\">brushing up on my JavaScript<\/a> on a Saturday night. Weekends are a mess of extroversion and social excess; I'll catch up with my friends during the week. And I'll look forward to that.\r\n\r\nBut. There is also the reality which is not wise to ignore: it's an extroverts world out there. As a society we tend to celebrate those who can shout the loudest, network the farthest and mesmerise an audience with the power of their voice and presence. These are fantastic and certainly enviable qualities to have, to an introvert they're far from natural. Thus we risk being forgotten, left on the bank as the river of extroversion rushes past towards an ocean of opportunities.\r\n\r\nAs introverts we need to both embrace this side of our personalities but also we must learn how to live and prosper in the extroverts world. The Internet certainly offers many great opportunities (keeping a blog, for instance) -- while at other times it really is worth putting that extra effort in and stepping, momentarily, outside the comfort zones.
