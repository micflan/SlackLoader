Danger of them being either officially sanctioned and self indulgent, or independent and frankly useless... but I gave this one a chance recently and I'm glad I did.\r\n\r\nThe music is, of course, brilliant. The journey of the band from early 90's Seattle to massive success is as interesting as any other (or perhaps more so, due to my foundness for early 90's Seattle rock groups) and there's no denying Cemeron Crowe can stitch a film together.\r\n\r\nWell worth watching. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt1417592\">IMDb<\/a> -- <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pearl_Jam_20\">Wikipedia<\/a> -- <a href=\"http:\/\/www.netflix.com\/Movie\/Pearl-Jam-Twenty\/70208108\">Netflix (US)<\/a>.","date":"April 4, 2012 04:44","title":"Pearl Jam 20","article_css":"","template_file":false,"categories":["Film","Music"],"author":"Michael Flanagan"}
