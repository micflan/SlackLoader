Ze Frank <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kickstarter.com\/projects\/zefrank\/a-show-with-ze-frank\">crowd-sourced $150k via Kickstarter<\/a> to make it happen.\r\n\r\nI remember I was living in Prague when the original was released in 2006. Good times. A fantastic little bit of Internet.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe whole concept of The Show seemed barely more thought out than \"release a video on the Internet every Monday to Friday for one year\". Mostly everything else was improv, ranging from whacky and surreal to\u00a0sombre\u00a0and heartfelt. A public experiment in forced creativity <em>every day<\/em>.\r\n\r\nHopefully this new Show won't suffer too much for being that \"difficult second album\" -- or from having $150k to play with and a legion of waiting fans. I'm definitely looking forward to finding out!","date":"March 19, 2012 02:57","title":"Return of The Show","article_css":"","template_file":false,"categories":["Creativity","Web"],"author":"Michael Flanagan"}
