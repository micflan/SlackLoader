{"uid":"iphones-and-androids-prices-and-contracts","content":"<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-99\" title=\"billpay\" src=\"\/assets\/\/2012\/04\/billpay.jpg\" alt=\"Bill Pay Plans\" \/>\r\n\r\nI was looking at the cost of smart phones recently on the Irish network, <a href=\"https:\/\/store.meteor.ie\/phones\/\">Meteor<\/a>. I couldn't really understand why the iPhone was so much cheaper at \u20ac49, compared to \u20ac119 for Galaxy Nexus, or \u20ac129 for the Galaxy S2. But I wasn't looking with any intention to buy, so didn't dwell on it at the time.\r\n\r\nYesterday, there was a somewhat related thread on <a href=\"http:\/\/boards.ie\/\">Boards.ie<\/a> and I mentioned that the price on offer makes the iPhone much more attractive. Someone cleared it up: look at the contracts.\r\n\r\nMeteor have <a href=\"https:\/\/store.meteor.ie\/phones\/bill-pay-phones\/apple-iphone-4s\">special contracts<\/a> for their iPhone users. These start at \u20ac45\/month for 24 months, which gets you 200 texts, 200 minutes and 5GB of data. Plus the \u20ac49 once-off fee, that means you're locked into paying <strong>\u20ac1174<\/strong> for the phone + service over 2 years.\r\n\r\nThe Android phones use the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.meteor.ie\/bill-pay\/#phone-plans\">standard meteor contracts<\/a>: a minimum \u20ac20\/month for 18 months, getting you 200 texts, 200 minutes and 1GB of data. (18 * 20) + 119 = <strong>\u20ac479<\/strong>. So actually, much <em>much<\/em> cheaper. Just a bit more up front.\r\n\r\nThe only difference the iPhone contract has over a standard contract is the tasty 5GB of data (compared with 1GB) but if you need more than one (which is probably fine for most), a 10GB add-on costs \u20ac15.24\/month, and that's still cheaper: (18 * 20) + 119 + (18 * 16) = \u20ac767. And twice the size! Although I'd prefer 5GB and half the price myself, but unfortunately they don't do that.\r\n\r\nSneaky feckers.","date":"April 3, 2012 03:52","title":"iPhones and Androids, Prices and Contracts","article_css":"","template_file":false,"categories":["Technology"],"author":"Michael Flanagan"}
