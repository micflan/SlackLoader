{"uid":"thoughts-on-enhancing-your-phpness","content":"<a href=\"\/assets\/\/2013\/02\/phpness.jpg\" alt=\"Enhance your PHPness\">This t-shirt<\/a> caused <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.calevans.com\/2013\/02\/22\/sexism-and-php\/\">a bit of<\/a> a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brandonsavage.net\/on-public-outrage-and-bad-actors\/\">moral outrage<\/a> recently following a PHP conference in London. I've commented on Twitter and on a couple of <a href=\"http:\/\/erikaheidi.com\/2013\/02\/24\/the-phpness-riot-and-the-sexism-overreaction\/\">blog posts<\/a> and I'd also like to record my thoughts here, for the record.\r\n\r\nFor me, the question of it being appropriate or not among professionals or at a conference is a separate issue. If that were the argument being raised I suspect it would (rightfully) be a quieter one, and I\u2019d be leaning towards the position that no, it\u2019s not the most appropriate slogan.\r\n\r\nBut sexism \u2013 \u201cdiscrimination on the basis of sex\u201d \u2013 I\u2019m deeply disappointed that some in the community would be so quick, brutal, and public with that accusation. Even going so far as to state unequivocally that any argument to the contrary is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.brandonsavage.net\/on-public-outrage-and-bad-actors\/\">\u201cpart of the problem\u201d<\/a>. It\u2019s a sad day when discussion is disallowed.\r\n\r\nYes we can strive for more professionalism within the community, but we are all adults here. There is absolutely a difference between a mild sexual reference pun and sexual discrimination.\r\n\r\nIt also seems there were many who <a href=\"https:\/\/gist.github.com\/AmyStephen\/5021337\">quickly jumped to the conclusion<\/a> (and apologised for only as an aside) that these women were some sort of hired \u201cBooth Babes\u201d. If that were your assumption then I think a long look in the mirror is needed before you start bandying around accusations of sexism.\r\n\r\nI sincerely believe that apologies are in order and I wish the women \u2013 and men \u2013 at <a href=\"webandphp.com\">webandphp.com<\/a> all the best in future. A slight misstep in humour is by no means deserving of this very public, serious and potentially damaging accusation.","date":"February 25, 2013 12:55","title":"Thoughts on enhancing your PHPness","article_css":"","template_file":false,"categories":["Personal","Technology","Web"],"author":"Michael Flanagan"}
