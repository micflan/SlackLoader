{"uid":"one-pomodoro","content":"I've been using the Pomodoro technique a bit recently, in an attempt to improve my personal time-management.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, it's dividing your time into 25 minute segments (each known as a pomodoro) and, well that's pretty much it. Instead of having minutes or hours to spend on a task, you have Pomodoros.\r\n\r\nTo keep on-track it's important to set a 25-minute alarm, or egg-timer, to sound when each Pomodoro ends. In practice, just setting that timer and knowing the clock is ticking turns out to be a great motivator in itself. I also find it's an interesting brain-hack to add this abstraction layer over time. It's not two frantic hours to get a task done, it's four distinct pomodoros. I can get a lot done in four energised and enthusiastic bursts; and that still leaves 20 minutes for polish (or rest).\r\n\r\nIt doesn't suit every task or project (at least I haven't found that it does) but for a lot of things it seems likes a useful technique.\r\n\r\n<strong>Links:<\/strong>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.pomodorotechnique.com\/\">pomodorotechnique.com<\/a> -- the official website. Far too much going on here, really. It's a pity it's not more simple to reflect the technique itself.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.pomodoro.me\/\">pomodoro.me<\/a> -- on the otherhand, very simple. This is what I use to time each Pomodoro.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pomodoro_Technique\">The Wikipedia entry for the Pomodoro Technique<\/a>","date":"September 28, 2012 08:49","title":"One Pomodoro.","article_css":"","template_file":false,"categories":["Personal"],"author":"Michael Flanagan"}
