{"uid":"new-music","content":"Recently, and\u00a0increasingly, my musical world has been split in two. There's the <em>old music<\/em>, the stuff I've bought and paid for probably many times over. The stuff they're still trying to charge me for again and again -- most recently with subscription services like <a href=\"http:\/\/spotify.com\">Spotify<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/deezer.com\">Deezer<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/rdio.com\">Rdio<\/a>. I love that music and damn it, I'll probably be paying the labels for access to it for a long time to come.\r\n\r\nThen there's the <em>new music<\/em>. Music that's discovered, distributed, shared and often purchased online. Sometimes directly from the artist (which works well for new material from established acts, such as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thekingoflimbs.com\/Store\/DisplayItems.html\">Radiohead<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nin.com\/albums\/\">Nine Inch Nails<\/a>), and sometimes discovered through sites such as <a href=\"http:\/\/soundcloud.com\/micflan\">SoundCloud<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/ex.fm\/micflan\">Ex.fm<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/mixlr.com\/micflan\">Mixlr<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/bandcamp.com\/\">Bandcamp<\/a>.\r\n\r\nIt's really great to see this new breed of music distribution and discovery sites appear online, and seemingly doing quite well. I've certainly grown to love and rely on them.","date":"June 8, 2012 16:11","title":"New Music","article_css":"","template_file":false,"categories":["Music","Technology","Web"],"author":"Michael Flanagan"}
