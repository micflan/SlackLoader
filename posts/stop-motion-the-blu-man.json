{"uid":"stop-motion-the-blu-man","content":"I made a little stop-motion animation using blu-tack:\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"375\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/peihY4KR5Yk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\r\n\r\nPretty short and insignificant but I had good fun creating it. Also I think I managed well enough with the character movements and timing for a first attempt!\r\n\r\nI used the <a href=\"http:\/\/boinx.com\/istopmotion\/ipad\/\">iStopMotion app for iPad<\/a> to create it, which, along with a good iPad stand, was a fun and easy way to do it. I quickly tried a couple of other stop-motion apps but concluded that iStopMotion was the best all-round. Although I'd like to be able to export the individual frames of the film, or maybe an animated gif file (at the moment it will only export video). Maybe they'll include that in a future update.","date":"June 13, 2012 03:44","title":"Stop-motion: The Blu Man","article_css":"","template_file":false,"categories":["I Made This","Personal"],"author":"Michael Flanagan"}
