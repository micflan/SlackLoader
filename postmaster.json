I was a bit sick of dealing with the plethora of unused features lurking in the WordPress admin panel, while simultaneously lacking the freedom to tinker with my own website, so I created something to cover the <em>bare<\/em> essentials of routing to pages, loading blog posts and creating syndication feeds (just rss for now).\n\n    Blog posts are loaded from JSON files, partly because I thought it might be fun to plug it into a remote REST source in future &mdash; although for now the files are stored on the server.\n\n    Pages are simply .php files. It could be a snippet of html to fit between the header and footer, or it can bypass the template altogether and do something unique. Up to you. Blog posts may also be assigned a 'page' to overwrite the default post template.\n\n    There's an awful lot of things it <em>doesn't<\/em> do which you might otherwise expect from something introduced as a \"blog manager\" but, aside from adding an easier way to create JSON files (which I will get around to), that's pretty much by design. There's actually some pieces I wrote over the weekend which I've since taken out &mdash; with an aim to impose as little as possible upon the author of each new page or post, while still providing something basicly useful.\n\n\n    I've named it <strong>SlackLoader<\/strong> because things need a name. The <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/micflan\/SlackLoader\">code is over on GitHub<\/a> and it's currently powering this site.\n","date":"April 16, 2013 09:39","title":"SlackLoader PHP &mdash; Static File Blog Loader","article_css":"","template_file":false,"author":"Michael Flanagan","categories":["Technology","I Made This"]},{"uid":"mass-effect","title":"Mass Effect","date":"April 11, 2013 01:34","categories":["Gaming","Gay \/ LGBT"],"author":"Michael Flanagan"},{"uid":"an-analogue-camera","title":"An Analogue Camera","date":"March 29, 2013 19:11","categories":["Technology","Uncategorized"],"author":"Michael Flanagan"},{"uid":"working-please-wait","title":"Working.
