# SlackLoader PHP

Basic page router and static-file blog loader.

With an aim to impose as little as possible, while still providing something useful, *SlackLoader* routes urls to php files, reads blog posts form JSON arrays and handles basic functionality such as pagination and rss feed generation.


I may (hopefully) get around to documenting but for now it should be possible to navigate the code enough to figure things out and get started.

I will build some sort of simple editor for those JSON files though. In the meantime there's newpost.php which you can edit and run. Not pretty but it does the job.
